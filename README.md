Project Overview

This repository contains a machine learning pipeline for classifying fermentation time of Lactococcus lactis into two categories based on genomic data. The model leverages three types of data matrices—GENE, SNP, and IGR—to build a robust binary classification model. The approach integrates feature selection, semi-supervised learning, and dual diffusion models for data augmentation to enhance classification performance. This method is particularly suited for handling high-dimensional biological datasets with limited labeled samples.
